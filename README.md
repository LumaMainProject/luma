# Luma

LUMA is not a wholesale marketplace — it’s a next-generation fashion platform that combines Instagram-based stores, TikTok-style video feeds, and Shopify-level selling tools. A visual-first marketplace for clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics, designed for users aged 16+, featuring short video reviews, instant purchases, same-day delivery, photo-based search, AR try-on, and a built-in seller ecosystem. Instagram sellers gain access to a personal dashboard, product uploads, analytics, customer chats, promotion tools, and integrated payment options making LUMA a locally adapted solution for scaling, automating, and growing fashion businesses in the mobile era.
